# Learning-AI

A collection of hands-on Jupyter Notebooks exploring machine learning, data science, and artificial intelligence. This repository reflects my self-driven journey to deepen understanding through real-world datasets and experimentation.

## Contents

**NLP_IMDb.ipynb**  
Perform sentiment analysis on IMDb movie reviews using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and basic machine learning models.

**Netflix_EDA.ipynb**  
Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Netflix dataset to uncover patterns in content types, genres, and release trends.

**heart_desease_kaggle_5_method.ipynb**  
Classify heart disease presence using five ML algorithms: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, and Naive Bayes.

## Technologies Used

Python  
Jupyter Notebook  
Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
Scikit-learn  
NLTK / TextBlob (for NLP)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**

   git clone https://github.com/AtaKimi/Learning-AI.git

2. **Install Dependencies**

pip install -r requirements.txt

Note: Some notebooks may require additional libraries (e.g. NLTK, TextBlob).

3. Run the Notebooks
